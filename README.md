# React-Hooks-Redux-in-48-Hours
We have published a book, "React Hooks Redux in 48 Hours", which helps readers understand React, React Hooks, Redux, Redux Middleware, Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, RTK, Recoil, XState, SWR, and various React related technology.    With CodeSandbox examples, readers can run sample programs in their browser, no need to waste their time by setting up the environment. The example codes used in this book are not for production projects but only for learning the concept. Many diagrams also help them understand visually. The goal is to help readers learn the React ecosystem quickly and guide them in the right direction.
